# All Your Base

Convert a number, represented as a sequence of digits in one base, to any other base.

Implement general base conversion. Given a number in base **a**,
represented as a sequence of digits, convert it to base **b**.

## Note

- Try to implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.

## About [Positional Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation)

In positional notation, a number in base **b** can be understood as a linear
combination of powers of **b**.

The number 42, *in base 10*, means:

(4 × 10¹) + (2 × 10⁰)

The number 101010, *in base 2*, means:

(1 × 2⁵) + (0 × 2⁴) + (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰)

The number 1120, *in base 3*, means:

(1 × 3³) + (1 × 3²) + (2 × 3¹) + (0 × 3⁰)

I think you got the idea!

*Yes. Those three numbers above are exactly the same. Congratulations!*

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`throw("Error")`, you should write:

```julia
throw("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```
## Version compatibility
This exercise has been tested on Julia 1.2.


## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/julia/all-your-base` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see [Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/tracks/julia/tests).
